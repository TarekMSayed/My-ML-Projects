- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html).
### Code

A template notebook is provided as `digit_recognition.ipynb`.
### Data
The dataset Arabic Handwritten Characters Dataset from Kaggle you can find it [here](https://www.kaggle.com/mloey1/ahcd1).
* The dataset is composed of 16,800 characters written by 60 participants, the age range is between 19 to 40 years, and 90% of participants are right-hand. Each participant wrote each character (from ’alef’ to ’yaa’) ten times.
* The database is partitioned into two sets: a training set (13,440 characters to 480 images per class) and a test set (3,360 characters to 120 images per class).
* Writers of training set and test set are exclusive.
* Ordering of including writers to test set are randomized to make sure that writers of test set are not from a single institution (to ensure variability of the test set).
